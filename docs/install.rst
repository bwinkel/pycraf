Requirements
============

pycraf has the following strict requirements:

- `Python <http://www.python.org/>`__ 3.10 or later

- `setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`__: Used for the package
  installation.

- `Cython <http://cython.org/>`__ 3.0 or later

- `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__ 2.0 or later

- `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`__: 1.7 or later

- `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__: 6.0 or later

- `pytest <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`__ 5.4 or later
-
- `pytest-remotedata <https://pypi.org/project/pytest-remotedata/>`__ 0.3.3 or later


There are a few optional packages, which are necessary for some functionality:

- `h5py <https://www.h5py.org/>`__ 3.3 or later: for caching.

- `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ 3.6 or later: To provide plotting
  functionality that `~pycraf.pathprof` enhances.

- `pyproj <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj>`__ 3.0 or later: This is a
  requirement for the `~pycraf.geospatial` sub-package.

- `sgp4 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sgp4>`__ 2.0 or later: This is a
  requirement for the `~pycraf.satellite` sub-package.

- `rasterio <https://pypi.org/project/rasterio/>`__ 1.2 or later: for geotiff reading in `~pycraf.pathprof` sub-package.

Older versions of these packages may work, but no support will be provided.

Installing pycraf
==================

There are various ways to install `pycraf`. The easiest and cleanest approach
would be to use the `Anaconda/Miniconda Python distribution
<https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_, because it allows to download
a binary package, which is well-tested against all dependency packages.

Using Anaconda
--------------
After installing Anaconda, one can run the `conda package manager
<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_::

    conda install pycraf -c conda-forge

.. note::

    `pycraf` and many other packages are not in default channel of Anaconda.
    So you have to use the conda-forge channel.

.. note::

    It is always a good idea to keep different projects separated and conda
    allows to easily create virtual environments. To set one up for `pycraf`::

        conda create -n pycraf-env -c conda-forge python=3.9 pycraf

    and to use it::

        conda activate pycraf-env

    Ideally, one would install all dependencies together with pycraf::

        conda create -n pycraf-env -c conda-forge python=3.11 astropy cython h5py matplotlib numpy pycraf 'pyproj>=2.6' pytest pytest-remotedata rasterio scipy 'sgp4>2'


Using pip
-------------

To install pycraf with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`__, simply run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pycraf

.. note::

    You may need a C compiler (``gcc``) with OpenMP support to be installed
    for the installation to succeed.

.. note::

    Use the ``--no-deps`` flag if you already have dependency packages
    installed, since otherwise pip will sometimes try to "help" you
    by upgrading your installation, which may not always be desired.

.. note::

    If you get a ``PermissionError`` this means that you do not have the
    required administrative access to install new packages to your Python
    installation.  In this case you may consider using the ``--user`` option
    to install the package into your home directory.  You can read more
    about how to do this in the `pip documentation
    <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/1.2.1/other-tools.html#using-pip-with-the-user-scheme>`__.
    Better would be to use virtual environments, e.g., base on `pipenv
    <https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__.

    However, we recommend to use a `Anaconda
    <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_, especially, if you are on
    :ref:`windows_install`.

    Do **not** install pycraf or other third-party packages as
    Administrator/Root unless you are fully aware of the risks.

.. _source_install:

Installation from source
------------------------

Linux
~~~~~
There are two options, if you want to build pycraf from sources. Either, you
install the tar-ball (`*.tar.gz` file) from `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycraf>`_ and extract it to the directory of
your choice, or, if you always want to stay up-to-date, clone the git
repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/bwinkel/pycraf

Then go into the pycraf source directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install .

Again, consider the ``--user`` option or even better use a python distribution
such as `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ to avoid messing up
the system-wide Python installation.


.. note::

    On Anaconda, the following would install all packages needed for
    properly working with the sources::

        conda create -n pycraf3.11dev python=3.11 'astropy>=6' cartopy
        cython extension-helpers ffmpeg fiona geopandas h5py ipdb
        ipykernel ipywidgets "matplotlib>=3.6" "numpy>=2" openpyxl osmnx
        pandas pip "pyproj>=3" "pyqt>=5.11" pytest pytest-astropy
        pytest-doctestplus pytest-qt pytest-remotedata python-build
        rasterio reproject scipy setuptools setuptools-scm "sgp4>2"
        shapely sphinx sphinx-astropy tqdm twine wheel

.. _windows_install:

Windows
~~~~~~~

If you are desperate, you can install pycraf from source even on Windows.
You'll need to install a suitable C-compiler; <see here
<https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers>`__. The pycraf
package needs Python 3.9 or later, which means VC++ Version 14 or later is
mandatory. The easiest way to obtain it, is by installing the
`Build Tools For Visual Studio
<https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022>`__. Once installed and
if all dependencies are there, the standard

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install .

should work.


.. note::

    `pycraf` uses `setuptools-scm` for automatic version numbering
    (based on the `git` hash). For this, `git` needs to be available in
    the terminal. (On Anaconda, it can be installed from conda-forge.)

.. _macos_install:

MacOS
~~~~~

Installation on MacOS can be a bit tricky, because the standard C compiler
does not support OpenMP. We provide wheels on PyPI, such that you can

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pycraf

however, you need to have the LLVM C compiler (see below), otherwise you'll
likely get an error message that a library (such as "libgomp") is not
found, when you import pycraf in Python.

Also, if you want to install from source, you must have a C compiler. There
are basically two options, using LLVM or the gcc suite. The recipe below
is likely outdated heavily, but we currently don't have access to a
MacOS machine. You may be able to adapt (if you're successful, let us know).

LLVM
^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    brew update
    brew install llvm

    export CC="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang"
    export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"

Then follow the instructions in :ref:`source_install`.

gcc
^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install gcc6  # or gcc7
    brew link --overwrite gcc@6  # or gcc@7

Then follow the instructions in :ref:`source_install`.

.. note::

    The MacOS wheel, which we provide on PyPI (for pip installation)
    was built using LLVM. So it may happen that you run into binary
    incompatibilities if you use a different compiler suite on your computer.
    In such cases it may be necessary to build pycraf from source using
    your own compiler. Sometimes even different compiler versions
    (e.g. gcc 6.3 instead of gcc 6.4) can lead to problems.
    Please write a ticket, if you run into trouble.

.. note::

    Again, if you're on Anaconda, things get (often) much simpler. One
    only needs to install the conda-forge compiler packages, before
    pip-installing:

     .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c conda-forge compilers llvm-openmp


.. _testing_installed_pycraf:

Testing an installed pycraf
=============================

The easiest way to test if your installed version of pycraf is running
correctly, is to use the `~pycraf.test()` function::

    import pycraf
    pycraf.test()

To run the tests for one sub-package, e.g., `conversions`, only::

    import pycraf
    pycraf.test('conversions')

The tests should run and print out any failures, which you can report at
the `pycraf issue tracker <http://github.com/bwinkel/pycraf/issues>`__.

.. note::

    This way of running the tests may not work if you do it in the
    pycraf source distribution directory.

.. note::

    By default, the `test` function will skip over tests that require
    data from the internet. One can include them by::

        import pycraf
        pycraf.test(remote_data='any')

    This will *always* download SRTM data (few tiles only) to test the
    auto-download functionality! Do this only, if you can afford the
    network traffic.

If you prefer testing on the command line and usually work with the source
code, you can also manually run the tests using `pytest`. Install the
package with `pip` and then (not within the project directory!):

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -rsx --ignore-glob="*/setup_package.py" --pyargs pycraf

    # to run tests from a sub-package
    pytest -rsx --ignore-glob="*/setup_package.py" --pyargs pycraf -P conversions

    # to run a particular test (uses globbing)
    pytest -rsx --ignore-glob="*/setup_package.py" --pyargs pycraf -k wgs84

    # include tests, which need to download data (will slow down tests)
    pytest -rsx --ignore-glob="*/setup_package.py" --pyargs pycraf --remote-data=any

Likewise, to build the docs (inside project directory!):

.. code-block:: bash

    sphinx-build docs docs/_build/html -b html

.. _srtm_data:

Using SRTM data
==================

To make full use of the path attenuation calculations provided by pycraf,
you will need to use NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
`(SRTM) data <https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/>`__ for height-profile
generation. Please see :ref:`working_with_srtm` for further details.
